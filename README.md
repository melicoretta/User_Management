# User_Management
This project is a simple PHP user and role management system designed to demonstrate core PHP fundamentals, including object‑oriented programming, inheritance, interfaces, traits, magic methods, exception handling, arrays, closures, and autoloading with Composer. It includes multiple user types (Admin and Customer), reusable traits, validation logic, static properties, and a demo script showcasing how the system works. The project follows PSR standards and provides a clean, modular structure suitable for learning or extending into a larger application.
